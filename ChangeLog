Version 0.3
    First public version.
    Actually works but losts of things are still missing.

    Fixed a silly bug that caused a lock up (threads terminated prematurely)
Version 0.3b
    Remove the FUNCTION_BEGIN ... testing code completely.
    Added proper copyright banners
Version 0.3f
    Fixed lots of stuff, added kill rules and keep rules.
Version 0.3g
    Fixed some minor portability issues.
Version 0.3h
    Fixed some problems with counting in case of errors

    Created transparant boolean readout for IniFile.
    Made the NNTProxy query its parameters from an IniFile.

    Added the option for username and password to login using AUTHINFO
    Fixed lockup problem when aborting.
Version 0.3j
    Changed the command syntax from just \n to \r\n and made this a 
    centralized issue. 
    Added a simple debug option to track the socket commands. 
Version 0.40
    Inifile: Setting a boolean was seen as a long.
    Regular expression matching of kill/keep rules.
    Case insensitive matching of kill/keep rules.
    Simple scoring system for all kill/keep rules.
    Added "Minimum Lines in a Message" as requested by Petri Laihonen.
Version 0.41
    SERIOUS BUG FIXED regarding the conversion from string to long.
    Fixed the creation of RPM files.
Version 0.50
    Added: You can check the progress when you do ps from a shell.
    Fixed: Bug reading a value in the ini file that contained an = in the value
    Added: Restart file so it is safe to make the temp dir empty after an aborted download session.
    Added: The headername "ArticleBody" can be used to create kill/keep rules that check for the actual article content.
    Added: MultiStreams, all messages pass through a single stream type that can be configured to pass the information to the cerr, cout , the current logfile and the syslogd.
    Rewrite: (Almost) All messages use the LogStreams now.
    Changed: The -init option now updates the INI file if it already exists.    
    Fixed: It is now possible to create an RPM and SRPM file.
Version 0.51
    Fixed: The restart file didn't include the killed messages.
    Fixed: Constant size memory leak (unimportant but I fixed it anyway).
    Changed: The makefiles have been improved and it's now possible to enable debugging without having to change the makefiles.
Version 0.52
    Added: Retry option when the server says "Connection refused". The default value doesn't change 0.51 behaviour.
    Fixed: In case some of the connections fail strange things happened. This exotic situation is handled better now.
    Added: Better handling of "430 No such article"
    Fixed: Some compiler errors in Mandrake 6.0 (querying www.deja.com helps)
    Changed: Suppress the warnings from compiling the regex.c file (It's clear I didn't write that monstrosity).
    Fixed: Some of the statistics didn't add up correctly.
    Fixed: The messages on the screen from the different threads will no longer mix through each other even if one thread uses \r to stay on the same line.
    Fixed: Invalid message of 1 restart ID when none were present (Win32).
    Fixed: Didn't do a closesocket at the end.
    Changed: The NNTPGetArticleCommand can now be restarted when the connection failed.
    Changed: The way the connections got their number for the messages.
Version 0.53
    Fixed: Uninitialized Memory Read in regular expression library.
    Changed: Can now use a "no posting" server (Thanks to Stephane Lentz)
    Updated: Some unimportant code layout stuff.
    Added: Compiler flags for IRIX (not fully tested).
    Added: The ini file can now contain comments that will be written back again.
    Fixed: forgotten #include <unistd.h> in DuplicatesChecker.cpp which didn't show up in SuSE 6.1
    Added: Maximum messages per group download feature if over limit.
    Changed: Default config file (if nothing is specified) is now /etc/suckmt.ini
    Changed: Default value for "Send MODE READER to the server" is now True.
    Improved: Installation prcedure now automagically includes a working config file.
    Fixed ?: Removed alarm call from GenericSocket.cpp, perhaps this solves the SIG_ALRM problem.
    Fixed ?: Removed regfree call from HeaderMatcher.cpp, perhaps this solves some unexplained crashes. It does introduce memory leaks at exit.
    Fixed: The mutexes in MultiStream.cpp which still allowed some race conditions.
