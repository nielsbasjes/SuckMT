Basic Installation and use.
===========================

1) Unpack the archive
   tar xzf suckmt.*.tar.gz

2) Build the executable
   cd suckmt.*
   make

3) Copy the final executable to a usable location
   cp suckmt /usr/bin          

4) Create a default config file (you can put this file anywhere you like).
   suckmt -init -i /etc/suckmt.ini
   
5) Add the news group(s) you want.
   You can just add them with a normal text editor or you can do 
   suckmt -i /etc/suckmt.ini -n nl.comp.os.linux

6) Configure the settings
   Manually edit the suckmt.ini file to something like this:

[Suck MT Configuration]
News server Hostname  = news.wirehub.nl
Storage Directory     = /etc/ppp/news/Msgs
Batch File            = /etc/ppp/news/batch
Number of threads     = 5

    I recommend you experiment with the "Number of threads" value (5 seems to
    work best in my situation).

7) To actually use suckmt just run it
   suckmt -i /etc/suckmt.ini 
   and everything is handled automagically.
   
8) You can kill on ANY header field of a message.
   To do this you add a line with
   
   headername:value
   
   in the [Kill Headers] section of the suckmt.ini.
   If a message contains a header with the headername and the specified value
   occurs somewhere in the actual value of the header the message will be
   killed. Note that alle strings are compare CASE-SENSITIVE !!!
   Example:
   
   Content-Type:text/html
   
   After you run suckmt this line will have been changed into something like
   this:
   
   Content-Type:text/html = Wed Sep 29 20:46:51 1999 ; 6

   The date is the start time of the suckmt run when this header was found. 
   The number after the ';' is the number of occurrances this rule has been 
   applied since it was put in the suckmt.ini file.
   
   The reason I added this is that if I manually inspect the suckmt.ini file I
   can see how often a kill rule has been applied and when the last occurrance
   was. This system isn't perfect (yet) because if multiple headers would be
   reason to kill a message only the status of the first one will be updated.


Content of the suckmt.ini file
==============================

The suckmt.ini has been created as a simple general config format for all 
settings relating to suckmt in a human edditable format.

Generic File format
===================

The file consists of sections. The start of the section foo is indicated 
by a line with [foo]. Each section consists of a group of settings. Each 
setting is a name and a value with an '=' in between. Both the name and the 
value are free text as long as it is on 1 line and the name cannot contain an '='
Each name must be unique in the section. If duplicate names are found the last 
one will overwrite the first one.

IMPORTANT: All names are CASE SENSITIVE !!

Sections can be split in muliple part but they will be rejoined automagically.

For example
[foo]
Harry = Man
Jill = !Man

[bar]
Harry = Man
Jill = !Man

[foo]
William = Man


will be rewritten into

[foo]
Harry    = Man
Jill     = !Man
William  = Man

[bar]
Harry  = Man
Jill   = !Man


Used contents of suckmt.ini
===========================
You can put a lot of settings into the suckmt.ini that are not used by the software.
I will only describe the actually used values. Please examine the suckmt.ini.sample file to get an idea how to store the information.

[Suck MT Copyright Information] contains some unimportant general information about suckmt.

[Suck MT Installation] contains some unimportant statistics about how often you have run suckmt. 

[Suck MT Configuration] contains the connection and storage information you'll know what they mean when you see them.

[News Groups] is a list of all the newsgroups that should be downloaded. The value that is stored is the article number where to start the next download.

[Kill Headers] are the headers that are cause to kill a message. Each line consists of 4 items:
- The header name
- The value to look for
- The date when the last ocurrence was found
- The number of matches that have been found till now

Examples:
Content-Type:multipart/alternative        = Wed Oct  6 20:27:51 1999 ; 25
Content-Type:multipart/mixed              = Wed Oct  6 20:27:51 1999 ; 8
Subject:TKA                               = Wed Oct  6 23:32:53 1999 ; 15
Subject:TKG                               = Wed Oct  6 20:27:51 1999 ; 7
Subject:overklok                          = Sun Oct  3 22:53:12 1999 ; 5
Subject:overclock                         = Mon Oct  4 20:34:45 1999 ; 3
From:droid@spam.free.net                  = Mon Oct  4 20:34:45 1999 ; 0


NOTES:
1) You can specify ANY header field.
2) All matches are case sensitive
3) If you want to specify a new rule you can just put something like this in here.
Subject:TKA
   Suckmt will automagically create the rest of the information for you.

[Keep Headers] are the headers that are cause to keep a message no matter if a kill match was found. The format and use of these line are identical to the Kill Headers.
