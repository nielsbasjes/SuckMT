Basic Installation and use.
===========================

1) Unpack the archive
   tar xzf suckmt.*.tar.gz

2) Build the executable
   cd suckmt.*
   make
   
3) Copy the final executable to a usable location
   cp suckmt /usr/bin          
   
4) Create a default config file (you can put this file anywhere you like).
   suckmt -init -i /etc/suckmt.ini
   
5) Add the news group(s) you want.
   You can just add them with a normal text editor or you can do 
   suckmt -i /etc/suckmt.ini -n nl.comp.os.linux

6) Configure the settings
   Manually edit the suckmt.ini file to something like this:

[Suck MT Configuration]
News server Hostname  = news.wirehub.nl
Storage Directory     = /etc/ppp/news/Msgs
Batch File            = /etc/ppp/news/batch
Number of threads     = 5

[Global Kill Rules]
Maximum Lines in a Message   = 300
Maximum Bytes in a Message   = -1
Maximum Groups in a Message  = 6

    I recommend you experiment with the "Number of threads" value (5 seems to
    work best in my situation).

7) To actually use suckmt just run it
   suckmt -i /etc/suckmt.ini 
   and everything is handled automagically.
   
8) You can kill on ANY header field of a message.
   To do this you add a line with
   
   headername:value
   
   in the [Kill Headers] section of the suckmt.ini.
   If a message contains a header with the headername and the specified value
   occurs somewhere in the actual value of the header the message will be
   killed. Note that alle strings are compare CASE-SENSITIVE !!!
   Example:
   
   Content-Type:text/html
   
   After you run suckmt this line will have been changed into this (added an
   '=') if no messages were killed during this run.
   
   Content-Type:text/html =
  
   If one or more messages were found then this line will look something like
   this:
   
   Content-Type:text/html = Wed Sep 29 20:46:51 1999 ; 6

   The date is the start time of the suckmt run when this header was found. 
   The number after the ; is the number of occurrances this rule has been 
   applied since it was put in the suckmt.ini file.
   
   The reason I added this is that if I manually inspect the suckmt.ini file I
   can see how often a kill rule has been applied and when the last occurrance
   was. This system isn't perfect (yet) because if multiple headers would be
   reason to kill a message only the status of the first one will be updated.
