This is the TODO list I currently have. 

Nr  Status  Description
 1  Done    Actually create usefull logging options (syslog ?). 
 2  Done    Parse the header fields
 3  Done    After (2): Create fully flexible header based killrules.
 4  NO      Automagically remove non-existant groups from suckmt.ini ??
 5  Partial Better handle error situations (no such group, cannot connect to server, server throttle, extremely slow server, etc).
 6  Partial Rewrite makefiles so they work on NT, Linux and Irix (use autoconf better !!).
 7  Partial Write manual pages and such.
 8  NO      Create an auto remove for header kill rules that haven't been used for a specified time.
 9  Partial Fix the handling if the server dies during download.
10          Add checks to see if the target directory and files exist and are writable.            
11          No shouting option (perhaps regular expression ?)
12          Create some sample scripts
13          Add capability to upload messages (make sure we can still download if we can't upload).
